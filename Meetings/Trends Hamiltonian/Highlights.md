* WHAT IS THE BIG QUESTION???
* Limit of the perturbation with $v \rightarrow \inf$ and $v \rightarrow 0$
  * Escape basins
  * 
* Investigate if there is some stickness
  * Time each particle take around a given cell
* Statistics of recors
* Small Alighment Method (SALI)
* Solomon golub advection
* Some kind of bifurcation as we change $A_2$
* Escape time for different values of v
* Levy Paper
* Coherent lagrangian structures
